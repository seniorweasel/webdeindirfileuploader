### How it Works

1. Users navigate to the File Uploader page on your application.
2. They are presented with a user-friendly interface that prompts them to select a file from their local device.
3. Once the file is selected, the user clicks the "Upload" button to initiate the file upload process.
4. The application validates the file to ensure it meets any specified requirements, such as file type or maximum file size.
5. If the file passes validation, it is uploaded to the server for processing and storage.
7. Once the upload is complete, the user gets a file ID and download link.


### Benefits
- Simplified file sharing: Users can easily upload and share files with others.

### Installation on server and usage:
To use the File Uploader:

1. Put all the files on "htdocs".
2. Make sure the file upload parameter is on in your php.ini file.
3. Check env.php and reconfigure the stuff for yourself in there. It includes all the settings related to basic stuff.
4. You can edit the front-end by yourself.
5. Monitor the progress indicators to track the upload status.
6. Once the upload is complete, you will be provided with a unique filename or identifier for your uploaded file.
7. You can then access and manage your uploaded files through the application's file management system.
